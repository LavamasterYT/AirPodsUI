# AirPodsUI
AirPodsUI adds the banners and toasts from iOS, macOS, and iPadOS to Windows! This includes the pencil looking banner, the pop-up card, and more! It will soon be customizable, allowing you to change the colors, icons, maybe fonts, and more.

## Features
Some of the main features include:

- Pairing any device, including weird ones like PCIe, ACPI, etc
- Customizable banners and pop-ups
- Good looking UI
- Flexibility
- And probably more

## Downloads
Currently, there are no downloads (see the next section), so the current way to test it out is to clone the repository and compiling it yourself. Until it is stable enough to release a beta, I will provide a setup file to download

## History
This project started out back in November of 2019 as a proof of concept. It originally added just the card that pop-ups when you open your AirPods on your phone. I posted it on r/airpods on Reddit where it gained some attenion, enough for me to continue to work on it. In April, I released an improved version that was much quicker than the previous version (it used to take like 20 seconds from when you open your airpods to the pop up to literally as soon as windows connects to it). After that I made some minor improvements, UI changes, etc and then took a long break (I was unmotivated to work on it). It wasn't until mid-September where I decided to pick up on it because I was bored and here we are.

## Support
For support, just create an issue and describe the problem as best as you can, and provide logs (whenever the beta or something releases) located in "Documents/AirPodsUI/logs/<latest>.log". I won't respond to my DMs anymore on Reddit or others for support, only here on GitHub issues. I am sorry if you have recently tried to reach out to me and ignored you, I have been inactive lately and forgot how my code works lol.
